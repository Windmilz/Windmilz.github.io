<p>Dropped out of Berklee to pursue playing the electric tortoise. Prefers using
a candlestick to finger-picking. Most of her lyrics examine the trials and
tribulations of repeatedly getting her heart broken by marine microbiology
majors. Met Dom and the other Boys at a Mingus fan art convention hosted
at the Hynes Convention Center.</p>
