  JP was raised in the woods by a pack of rabid rabbits. This directly translated into his aptitutde towards mirco (and macro) tonal jazz.
  Unable to properly communicate using any written language, JP utilizes art to illustrate feelings and ideas, which is seen in "The Berkleé Boys" where he expresses himself using a variety of conventional and non-conventional instruments, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Tree trunk<li>
      <li><b>Two<b> rocks<li>
      <li>Keyboards<li>
      <li>Basically anything else<li>
    <ul>
