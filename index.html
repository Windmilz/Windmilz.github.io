<h1>We are the Berkleé Boys!</h1>
<h2>And This is our band!</h2>
<div>
<h3>Døm</h3>
  <p>
Döm is the Electric Flugle Horn player in the hit band, The Berkleé Boys<br>
In his free time Dom loves to read the story of Don Quixote and ponder about the wonders of the universe.<br>
One day while Dõm was equating the meaning of E = MC^2, Mingus approached him with a blazing blue electric Flugle horn, inviting him to join the coveted <strong>Berkleé Boys</strong>.<br>
Dœm excells at many things such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Manifesting crocadiles</li>
      <li>Baking</li>
      <li>Keyboards deconstruction</li>
      <li>And Drumminng</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
<h4>Sungha</h4>
  <p>
Sungha plays the accordion and the kalimba in the band.
  </p>
<h5>Claire(courtney)</h5>
  <p>
Dropped out of Berklee to pursue playing the electric tortoise. Prefers using
a candlestick to finger-picking. Most of her lyrics examine the trials and
tribulations of repeatedly getting her heart broken by marine microbiology
majors. Met Dom and the other <strong>Boys</strong> at a Mingus fan art convention hosted
at the Hynes Convention Center.

<h6>JP</h6>
  <p>
JP was raised in the woods by a pack of rabid rabbits. This directly translated into his aptitutde towards mirco (and macro) tonal jazz.
Unable to properly communicate using any written language, JP utilizes art to illustrate feelings and ideas, which is seen in "The Berkleé Boys" where he expresses himself using a variety of conventional and non-conventional instruments, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Tree trunk</li>
      <li><b>Two</b> rocks</li>
      <li>Keyboards</li>
      <li>Basically anything else</li>
    <ul>
