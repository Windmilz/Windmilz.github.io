<p>Döm is the Electric Flugle Horn player in the hit band, The Berkleé Boys<br>
In his free time Dom loves to read the story of Don Quixote and ponder about the wonders of the universe.<br>
One day while Dom was equating the meaning of E = MC^2, Mingus approached him with a blazing blue electric Flugle horn, inviting him to join the coveted <strong>Berkleé Boys</strong>.<br>
Dœm excells at many things such as: <ul>
    <li>Manifesting crocadiles</li>
    <li>Baking</li>
    <li>Keyboards deconstruction</li>
    <li>And Drumminng</li>
</ul></p>

<h5>Claire(courtney)</h5>
<p>Dropped out of Berklee to pursue playing the electric tortoise. Prefers using
a candlestick to finger-picking. Most of her lyrics examine the trials and
tribulations of repeatedly getting her heart broken by marine microbiology
majors. Met Dom and the other Boys at a Mingus fan art convention hosted
at the Hynes Convention Center.</p>
